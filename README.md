## Lessons Learned
1.  One of the first things I learned was to use `background-repeat: no-repeat;` to prevent an image from repeating. I was able to use these CSS code on `.split.left` and `.split.right` to keep both images from repeating.

2. :root element can be useful global css variables such as the background color that was used.
